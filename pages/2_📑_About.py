        application that allows users to analyze force data derived \
        from squat jumps. These squat jumps were done by subjects \
        recovering from ACL-reconstruction surgery. Users are able \
        to interact with the analysis program through the dashboard \
        in Streamlit.")
    st.markdown("Jump data in the form of a CSV can be dragged and \
        dropped in the dash. Metrics, such as peak force, jump height, \
        and timestamps are calculated in the back-end and returned to the \
        user via multiple visualizations. The calculation results can be \
        downloaded as a CSV for further analysis/comparision.")

with tab2:
    st.markdown("**Motivation**:")
    st.markdown("The key motivation was to make an analysis program that \
        is constructive and accessible for users who can diagnose ACL \
        injuries or work with people recovering from ACL reconstruction. \
        These users most likely do not have enough knowledge or time to \
        compute the jump metrics themselves, or are not able to create \
        an automated program from scratch.")

        accurately identify timestamps of jump events in order to \

    To use this web application dashboard, please directly upload \
